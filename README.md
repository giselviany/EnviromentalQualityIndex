# EnviromentalQualityIndex
Applied Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to examine the relationship between environmental quality indicators (IKLH) and environmental resources (SDL) using 2023 data from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS).  
●	Analyzed the relations between environmental quality variables including air quality (IKU), water quality (IKA), and soil quality (IKTL), alongside the agricultural productivity variables such as rice (PP), corn (PJ), and peanuts (PKT).  
●	Performed hypothesis testing to validate the assumptions required for Canonical Correlation Analysis.  
●	Demonstrated a strong link between environmental quality and agricultural productivity, emphasizing the need for policies to improve water quality and agricultural outputs for sustainable development.
